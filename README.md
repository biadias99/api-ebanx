# API - Ebanx - Tech Test

RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js to solve the EBANX Tech Challenge for Software Engineer opportunity.

The solution uses mock data to simulate the entities: balance and event.

My goal was to create a clean, modular foundation that's easy to extend and maintain, allowing future modifications without major refactoring.
